description: Unified standard for Java backend project design, implementation, refactoring, and code review. Use when Codex needs to build or modify a Java backend that should follow module-first organization, preferred top-level module naming `infrastructure / persistence / business / web`, `interfaces` for multi-entry projects, optional `integration` for heavy third-party integrations, detailed naming and commenting rules, explicit security baselines, maintainability governance, and full module API regression after each module is completed.

# Java Backend Unified Spec

## Rule Levels

Use the following rule levels across reference files:

- `MUST`: default mandatory baseline for new projects and for modified areas in existing projects
- `RECOMMENDED`: preferred default; legacy projects may adopt incrementally based on cost and risk
- `OPTIONAL`: choose according to business type, traffic model, team size, and compliance needs

## Workflow

1. Split the work by project goal or business requirement into modules first. Do not flatten the project into one global `controller / service / repo` structure.
2. Read only the relevant reference file before designing or editing code:
   - architecture and module boundaries: [references/architecture-and-boundaries.md](references/architecture-and-boundaries.md)
   - naming, comments, validation, and code quality: [references/coding-standards.md](references/coding-standards.md)
   - security, third-party integration, concurrency, testing, and delivery: [references/security-integration-and-delivery.md](references/security-integration-and-delivery.md)
   - secure baseline for secrets, sensitive data, upload/download, callback protection, and release checks: [references/secure-baseline.md](references/secure-baseline.md)
   - maintainability governance for compatibility, ADR, module README, and quality gates: [references/evolution-and-governance.md](references/evolution-and-governance.md)
   - reusable templates and the single source of truth for PR, review, delivery, and release checklists: [references/templates-and-checklists.md](references/templates-and-checklists.md)
   - templates and example implementations: [references/code-examples.md](references/code-examples.md)
3. Apply the preferred top-level structure: `infrastructure / persistence / business / web`. Use `interfaces` instead of `web` when the project has multiple inbound entry types such as HTTP, MQ, scheduled jobs, and webhooks.
4. Add `integration` only when third-party integrations become large enough to deserve an independent infrastructure module.
5. Keep HTTP request and response objects in `web` or `interfaces/http` only. Let `business` orchestrate use cases. Push strong business rules into `domain`. Keep `persistence` focused on data access and raw query/write results. Repo or RepoImpl should not translate update-failed, not-found, or status-illegal semantics into business exceptions; when stable business error codes are required, `ServiceImpl` or a project-level business assert/helper should translate those results explicitly.
6. Enforce naming strictly:
   - constants by category: `XxxErrorCodes`, `XxxPermissionCodes`, `XxxRiskRuleCodes`, `XxxNoRepeatKeys`, `XxxLockKeys`, `XxxApiPaths`, `XxxSecurityPaths`, `XxxErrorMessages`
   - enums end with `Enum`
   - API paths use short hyphen-case
   - module, package, directory, and class naming should follow the detailed rules in the reference doc
7. Put third-party integrations such as `OSS`, `TTS`, `AI`, SMS, payment, and push clients in `infrastructure/client` by default. If integrations grow large, split them into `integration/client`, but keep them inside infrastructure boundaries.
8. Keep business orchestration in `business` and callback, webhook, MQ, or job entrypoints in `web` or `interfaces`.
9. Keep `Assembler` and `Convert` as distinct layers. `Assembler` belongs to `web / interfaces` and handles entry-layer adaptation such as `Request -> Command` and `VO -> Response`. `Convert` belongs to `business` and handles business-layer cross-object assembly such as `DO -> VO`, `DO -> DTO`, and internal snapshot conversion. Only skip `convert` for genuinely special cases where the object assembly is one-off, very short, and can be expressed clearly with a local `Builder`.
10. Ban magic strings and magic numbers in business code. Do not use catch-all constant classes such as `Constants` or `CommonConstants`. Even short business prefixes, version prefixes, and object-key path fragments such as `"v"` or `"video-cut/export/"` count as magic strings when they carry business meaning.
11. Choose a single explicit concurrency strategy for each business chain and keep it centralized. Do not mix multiple ad hoc concurrency styles in the same workflow.
12. When Codex generates or modifies Java backend code, Chinese comments are mandatory for classes, `public` / `protected` methods, Repo methods, Convert methods, key business fields, and non-obvious business branches. Field comments should explain clear business meaning, units, status semantics, source, or usage boundary when the name alone is not enough.
13. For pure carrier objects such as `Request` / `Response` / `Command` / `Query` / `VO`, prefer Lombok annotations to remove boilerplate accessors. When both read and write access are needed, prefer `@Data`; when only read access is needed, prefer `@Getter`. For command payloads, DTOs, VOs, snapshot payloads, or convert targets that are primarily assembled in one place, favor `@Builder`; if a `Command`, `Query`, or `VO` must behave as a normal mutable carrier with routine getter/setter access in the current project, still prefer `@Data`. For enums, default to `@Getter` only and do not add `@Setter`. Do not handwrite trivial getter/setter methods unless framework constraints or non-trivial logic make them necessary.
14. For simple guard-style checks such as basic null existence, duplicate submission, active-task conflicts, and straightforward preconditions, default to a project-level unified validation helper, commonly exposed as `Validate.notNull(...)`, `Validate.notBlank(...)`, `Validate.isTrue(...)`, `Validate.equal(...)`, and `Validate.notEqual(...)`. Do not manually compose repetitive low-level templates such as `Validate.isTrue(ObjectUtil.isNotNull(...), "...不能为空")`, `Validate.isTrue(ObjectUtil.equal(...), "...")`, or `Validate.isTrue(ObjectUtil.notEqual(...), "...")` inside business methods. As a general heuristic, when one business statement combines multiple low-level helpers plus business-facing message, error code, or exception semantics, treat it as an extraction candidate by default rather than an inline expression. If the project standardizes Apache Commons Lang3 and Hutool, keep them behind the helper or in genuinely low-level utility code rather than repeating raw combinations throughout the business layer. For ordinary conditional composition and general-purpose helper code, default to Hutool rather than hand-written mini utilities: use `ObjectUtil.isNull(...)` / `isNotNull(...)` for object null checks, `ObjectUtil.equal(...)` / `notEqual(...)` for null-safe equality, `StrUtil.isBlank(...)` / `isNotBlank(...)` or `isEmpty(...)` / `isNotEmpty(...)` for strings, `CollUtil.isEmpty(...)` / `isNotEmpty(...)` for collections, `BooleanUtil.isTrue(...)` / `isFalse(...)` for boxed or tri-state boolean flags, and related Hutool helpers such as `MapUtil`, `ArrayUtil`, `BeanUtil`, `JSONUtil`, `DateUtil`, `IdUtil`, `URLUtil`, `HttpUtil`, or `HttpRequest` for common utility and lightweight HTTP tasks. Keep URL and HTTP helper usage inside `infrastructure/client` or `integration/client` boundaries and still satisfy timeout, retry, protocol validation, allowlist, and SSRF-protection requirements. Do not scatter raw `if (...) { throw ... }` for simple precondition failures, do not repeatedly handwrite patterns such as `x != null && !x.isBlank()`, `Objects.equals(x, y)`, or `Boolean.TRUE.equals(flag)`, and do not invent local helper functions for capability already well covered by Hutool. Only deviate in special cases where existing project infrastructure, compatibility constraints, or stronger framework abstractions are already stable and explicitly required. For failures that must expose stable business error codes, such as not-found, update-failed, or status-illegal semantics, use `BizException` or a project-level business assert/helper such as `BizAssert` instead of naked `Validate`. Repo write methods should usually return `boolean`, affected-row count, saved entity identity, or typed result; `ServiceImpl` is responsible for turning those results into business failure semantics. Validation annotation messages should use business-facing Chinese such as `项目不能为空` or `时间轴不能为空`, not field-name-oriented wording such as `projectId不能为空` or `timelineDslJson不能为空`.
15. After each module is completed, regression test all APIs in that module, not only the endpoints changed in the current task.
